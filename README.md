# video_to_audio_converter

a Python script that uses the MoviePy library to extract audio from a video file selected by the user using a file dialog provided by Tkinter. It then saves the extracted audio as an MP3 file named "demo.mp3" and prints "END" to the console. 

Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:


1. `import moviepy.editor`: This imports the `moviepy.editor` module, which is used for video editing tasks.

2. `from tkinter.filedialog import *`: This imports the `askopenfile` function from the `tkinter.filedialog` module. This function is used to open a file dialog and let the user select a video file.

3. `vid = askopenfile()`: This line opens a file dialog for the user to select a video file. The selected file is then assigned to the `vid` variable.

4. `video = moviepy.editor.VideoFileClip(vid)`: This line creates a `VideoFileClip` object from the selected video file (stored in the `vid` variable). This object represents the video file and allows you to perform operations on it.

5. `aud = video.audio`: This line extracts the audio from the `VideoFileClip` object and assigns it to the `aud` variable.

6. `aud.write_audiofile("demo.mp3")`: This line saves the extracted audio as an MP3 file named "demo.mp3" in the current working directory.

7. `print("END")`: Finally, this line prints "END" to the console to indicate that the script has finished running.

Make sure you have the MoviePy library installed (` pip install moviepy `) and that you have Tkinter available (it's typically included with Python) for the file dialog to work. Also, ensure you have a video file selected when running the script.
